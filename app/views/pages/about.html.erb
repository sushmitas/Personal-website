<p>When I was growing up I wanted to be a detective or a musician. I wanted to 
investigate people and get to the bottom of a mystery. Or I wanted the chance 
to express myself creatively in a way that reached people. In a lot of ways, I'm 
living up to my childhood dreams by indulging both my curious and my creative urges. 
I love talking to people, finding out what makes them tick, and then designing
something that improves their life in some way. Turns out being an interaction 
designer fits me well. </p>

<p>When I'm not designing, I enjoy cooking and eating food, making art and music, 
running, biking, dancing, hanging out with my husband and my friends, and
playing with my cat.</p>
