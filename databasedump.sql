I worked as Project Lead on a team of 5 students to conduct exploratory research and to design and test a solution. I conducted contextual interviews with researchers to better understand their goals and issues they faced. During the design phase, I generated concept storyboards and paper prototypes to tease out the most important values and needs. We then focused in on a few key concepts and generated a system that incorporated the main values addressed in these concepts. We held think aloud sessions with participants, and conducted heuristic evaluation of our end system. I co-developed a web prototype with another technical member on the team.</p> \r\n\r\n<p><b>Results</b>\r\n<br />\r\nWe designed a solution called Digital Vita that provided an online repository for researchers to store their professional information. Using this repository, they are able to easily generate grant applications and also search through others\' information to find relevant collaborators. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDigital Vita is currently in use at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

We expected to hear horror stories about roommate conflicts, but were surprised to hear a common expression of pride about how well they managed their lives together and even had fun! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We created several storyboard concepts; amongst these, I came up with the concept for Picture Pal - a way to capture \"kodak moments\" in roommates\' lives and display them. We presented this and 10+ other concepts to roommates and found that people really valued staying connected to their home, spending time together, and displaying a sense of house pride. We fleshed out the Picture Pal concept to provide roommates a way to stay connected, to capture and reminisce about good times, and to share their lives with others. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Results</b>\r\n<br />\r\nFinal deliverables: <a href=\"/files/projects/picturepal/files/PicturePalFinal.ppt\" >(presentation)</a> \r\n<a href=\"/files/projects/picturepal/index.html\" >(project website)</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class = \"label span-18\">\r\n<br />\r\nMedia:\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/19116702\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<!--object CLASSID=\"clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" CODEBASE=\"http://www.apple.com/qtactivex/qtplugin.cab\">\r\n<param name=\"src\" value=\"/files/projects/picturepal/files/VidSketchFinal.wmv\">\r\n<param name=\"autoplay\" value=\"false\">\r\n<param name=\"loop\" value=\"false\">\r\n<param name=\"controller\" value=\"true\">\r\n<embed src=\"/files/projects/picturepal/files/VidSketchFinal.wmv\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" autoplay=\"false\" loop=\"false\" controller=\"true\" pluginspage=\"http://www.apple.com/quicktime/\"></embed>\r\n</object-->\r\n\r\n</div>','A new way to keep roommates connected','2011-01-20 22:58:56','2011-01-30 07:04:06','picturepal','2007-03-01','2007-05-01'),(14,'Instant Hoot','<!-- Column 1 -->\r\n<div class=\"span-8\">\r\n<img alt=\"Instant Hoot Logo\" src=\"/images/projects/instanthoot/LogoImage.png\" title=\"Instant Hoot Logo\" class=\"project_logo\"/>\r\n<b>Research/Design Methods</b><br />\r\nsurvey/questionnaire, think aloud interviews, cognitive walkthrough, high fidelity prototyping, software development, and heuristic evaluation\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Column 2 -->\r\n<div class=\"prepend-1 span-10 last\">\r\n<div class=\"project_text\">\r\n<p><b>Goal</b>\r\n<br />Develop a proof of concept system that Improves efficiency and ease of use while text messaging\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Process</b>\r\n<br />I worked with two other students to research, design and test a concept that we called Instant Hoot.
