					<p><strong>Roommate  Set 1</strong></p>
					<p>need:  cooordination device<br>
					  Not  necessarily wishlist - but *centralized shopping list* for the apartment. this  would be useful.<br>
					  ppl buy  things with the intent of sharing with roommates</p>
					<p>need:  favors<br>
					  favors  just happen, you can't control them. they wouldn't want structure in place for  this.<br>
					  Makes  extra food on purpose, sometimes to share, sometimes for the next day. offer it  if other sare around the kitchen, but never planned. no desire to coordinate  dinner schedules and dietary restrictions.</p>
					<p>need:  appreciation<br>
					  -not as  important of a need<br>
					  would  probably just thank them the next time they saw them if they weren't around.  when someone's doing a chore, someone else is usually around to pitch in.<br>
					  might not  take a reward system seriously. structured system would fade over time.  incentives would fade over time.<br>
					  the  trigger to clean is when the mess is restricting from doing something.<br>
					  when  someone goes out of their way, it would be nice to get appreciation, but in a  spontaneous way. shouldn't be required to give thanks.</p>
					<p>need:  awareness<br>
					  they're  pretty good right now about being aware. good at communicating already when in  person.<br>
					  this  would be really useful to find out how others are feeling when you're not  around each other.<br>
					  liked the  noiseminder - ppl often have to remind each other to put the volume down.<br>
					  it would  be useful to see *who's home* at what time - helps coordinate social  activities. otherwise hard to coordinate with so many ppl.</p>
					<p>need:  communication/coordination<br>
					  they talk  a lot so no need for technology to help with communication, but would be  helpful for coordination<br>
					  doorchat  would be cool - maybe it should be in a central place for asynchronous  communication? usually if they're not working, they'd be downstairs together.  don't mind it if ppl interrupt them and come into their room.<br>
					  *showerviz*  - would be useful. in their house ppl have their own showers, but with common  space it would be useful.<br>
					  *kitchenviz*  would definitely be useful b/c there's not a ton of counter space.<br>
					  TV viz -  mabye useful depending on the ppl<br>
					  they want  this to be like a reservation system - let system know in advance</p>
					<p>need:  social<br>
					  ppl def  have great house moments. *kodak moments* could be fun. right now ppl just  email photos out. came up with picture frame where you could toggle thru photos  in the house and visitors could see activities of the house.<br>
					  specific  need: not only capturing the photos, but *sharing* the photos with ppl outside  of the house. showing off how good their social relationship is<br>
					  house  robot - not that useful. they have a common shelf where they leave stuff so ppl  know others can take it. robots can be novelty/fun but not useful.<br>
					  comic  book - interesting idea. could help invite ppl to events (awareness) and works  as a common calendar (coordination).<br>
					  specific  need: communication/coordination</p>
					<p>need:  responsibility<br>
					  location  stick - ppl know where the mess is, but someone putting the stick down  anonymously shows they're concerned about a mess. this works as an opinion  system. not obnoxious but still shows that something annoys you.<br>
					  specific  need: addresses social awkwardness<br>
					  Kill the  Dirt Pet - would really annoy b/c cleaning is not fun and the pet would make it  worse.<br>
					  Collect  Em All - gold star system didn't work when you were a kid either.</p>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong>Roommate  Set 2</strong><br>
				  *idea  name here* = they liked it</p>
					<p>Favors<br>
					  wishlist:  One gives the other rides to costco and has also sometimes just bought mt. dew  (which other roommate loves) for him without being asked.<br>
					  dinnerbell:  They always make extra food. They didn't feel a need for this. Pretty much if  someone was around then they would give them the extra and if not it would be  packed up and put in the fridge. They could see if each other are home and  proceed appropriately.</p>
					<p>Didn't  like the appreciation solutions:<br>
					  Leaving a  note for another person thanking them interferes with the spontaneousness of it  and takes away genuineness.<br>
					  People do  the dishes and no one ever knows who did it. Still didn't feel the need for this  solution.<br>
					  kudos  didn't like because he felt that if making reward extrinsic takes away from  intrinsic motivation. Will end up doing it less or at least feeling like doing  chores less.</p>
					<p>Magnettug-  didn't like because generally when they are in bad moods they want the option  to seal themselves off from the world. Don't want sympathy (this may be a male  vs. female thing or extrovert vs. introvert thing.) If they want other people  to know how they are feeling they use the away messages in Aim/gmail etc.<br>
					  Roomlight-  privacy issues. also same as above.<br>
					  *Noiseminder*-  they both liked and thought it was useful. After being probed, they said that  they thought it was helpful both from the side when they want to go to sleep  but also when they are making the noise. Their perception is that people are  never noisy on purpose just don't realize they are waking other ppl up.<br>
					  *Doorchat*-  They currently use im/e-mail for this. They don't feel like the need it to show  they are busy/studying but may be more helpful for leaving notes for later such  as that someone called for them. They both liked it and thought it was useful.<br>
					  showerviz-  this is a problem. but after admitting it was a problem both of them basically  said it isn't really. other roommate has no pattern. user takes at night but  this could be any time between 6pm-6am (whenever he goes to sleep). Kitchenviz-  not a problem. One uses stove, one uses oven.</p>
					<p>They feel  in general they are good about communication (when they are pissed off), and  don't need help facilitating it.</p>
					<p>Kodakmoment-  privacy issues. visual not helpful as far as they are concerned. Would be much  more interested in a quote keeper that recorded funny lines or quotes. They  thought all the pictures would end up looking the same and no one would have  any idea what they were of. Also a problem managing/organizing them.</p>
					<p>Robot-  they were amused by it and liked it but it didn't seem like they really needed  it.<br>
					  househeroes-  ditto.</p>
					<p>*locationsticks*-  &quot;We would have the best catologued mess.&quot;<br>
					  Seemed to  like it although, I am not sure from what they said if they would really use it  or just throw a stick in a pile and then be like, oh I tagged it. Seemed to  think it was a good idea though. reminder to do cleaning, favors,  responsiblility (3 of our themes) all together. Also, could be used as a gps  tagging type of things. Want to remember where something is, throw a stick at  it. Want to remember to take something out with you, could throw a stick at it  . Could be used in more than one way.</p>
					<p>kill the  dirt pet- &quot;don't need to make mess personified&quot; would not find  motivating.<br>
					  collectemall-  want to be able to choose when to do favors for friends, not be forced into it.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><strong>Roommates  Set 3 and 4</strong></p>
					<p>*wishlist*:  good way to coordinate buying groceries. right now, roommateJ just buys stuff  for himsefl b/c they have no concept of what roommateG would need. would be  helpful to coordinate.<br>
					  roommateE  thinks it makes sense, but she shops with her roommate, and with her old  roommate they had a standard list of shared groceries. and whoever was at the  groceries would buy it.<br>
					  roommateA  thinks it would be useful to know what roommateE needs. roommateE prob wouldnt  make such a list, but roommateA would be useful with other roommates.<br>
					  shared  shopping list . maybe if it knows where you are it could give contextual  reminders.<br>
					  maybe  could tie in with moodboard: &quot;your roommate is grumpy and they like ice  cream when they're grumpy.&quot;</p>
					<p>dinnerbell:  roommateJ cooks and sometimes there's extra and tell the guys that they can eat.  happens seldom that they are all there at the same time.<br>
					  if  roommateE and roommateA are cooking extra food it is to share. usually they  arrange schedule to cook together. lots of planning to coordinate dinners  together. go to groceries together. more of a need for coordination system.</p>
					<p>thankyou  note: set3 liked the idea of having a noninvasive way of thanking someone.<br>
					  set4  think that the reward is diff than thank you notes. roommateJ would clean the  bathroom if roommateG cleaned the kitchen.</p>
					<p>ppl seem  to have roles that have come about, but not assigned. incremental cleaning.  also usually spontaneous cleaning when there's a huge mess or when a guest  comes.</p>
					<p>kudos:  would have to be electronic and automatically tallied.<br>
					  appreciation  is more implicit in the things ppl do for each other. generally supposed to do  half of it.<br>
					  ppl spend  a lot of time cleaning and other person doesnt always notice. when set4 do work  it's always visible.<br>
					  *would be  nice to have an easy non-intrusive way to make it apparent that someone did a  lot of work and thank the other person.<br>
					  roommateG  worried about token economy thing - if there is an imbalance in that, it would  be tangible and might increase tension.</p>
					<p>sometimes  systems in place for this appreciation or chore dividing indicate that there is  something wrong. the ppl end up interacting more formally.</p>
					<p>magnettug:  set3 would want each other to know each other's mood. would need more than  happy/sad - more like &quot;don't bug me&quot;<br>
					  roommateJ  thinks it would be really good - household, you have a closer relationship. if  you don't know each other's moods, it can be an awkward situation.</p>
					<p>both  agreed that communication is important. &quot;happy/sad' not indicative -  should indicate what they expect their roommate to do &quot;<br>
  &quot;i'm  in a bad mood, f* off&quot; vs. &quot;i'm in a bad mood, and i want you to  comfort me&quot;</p>
					<p>roomlight:  want to be able to shut it off. the color thing could be really need - has a  big impact<br>
					  if the  room is dirty, you'd like the lights to dim so you don't have to see it. could  also show roommate you think it's messy.</p>
					<p>noiseminder:  roommateG wishes he had this as an undergrad. roommateJ thinks it's really  useful - studying w/ loud music and forgets the time.<br>
					  good way  to save face without having to tell them to turn it down. even neighbors could  tie this in.<br>
					  set3  think it should detect how loud the sound would seem to the other person.</p>
					<p>doorchat:  kinda what IM is for already. roommateA cant see her bedroom door from where  she's sitting. they already IM each other from their rooms.<br>
					  roommateJ  thinks it would make sense to have it in a central place for asynchronous  messages. more like a central whiteboard/blackboard. works well when you're  totally on diff. schedules. digital version that could connect to your mobile  devices. could send and get stuff from it from remote locations.</p>
					<p>*showerviz*:  seems useful if you have a lot of roommates. coordinating with one isnt hard.  with roommateE's old roommate, it would be useful.<br>
					  roommateJ  thinks it would be useful b/c it's a single resource and has potential for  conflicts. sometimes they all get up at the same time.<br>
					  would  work well as a reservation system - maybe could tap into schedule to estimate  when ppl are likely to use it.<br>
					  erin thinks it would def work well for TV.<br>
					  make  showertime more efficient, valuable - allow ppl to see presentations, etc.<br>
					  could  even coordinate this for when they're going grocery shopping and when they're  out of stuff.</p>
					<p>*kodakmoments*:  could be really fun. should have an off the record mode. should be able to  annotate the pics.</p>
					<p>houserobot:  why couldnt ppl just present it yourself? should do the crapwork.<br>
					  in terms  of sharing stuff, it's more of a &quot;come and get some&quot; - kitchen  counter and stove.</p>
					<p>*househeroes*:  roommateG likes comic books, but would like it to not be about chores. likes  the celebration thing.<br>
					  would be  nice to reflect on last week's to see what they didnt do. could almost work in  conjunction with the pictures.<br>
					  reflecting  backwards would be a lot better than reflecting forwards.</p>
					<p>*location  stick*: roommateE would rather just say she's annoyed about it. roommateA  thinks it could be cool instead of saying you're annoyed. maybe there should be  some text along with it. marking the door might be ambiguous - so text or  addiitonal info would help. roommateG kinda likes the idea of throwing  something to mark it.<br>
					  could  also work as a reminder for yourself as well. get a sense of checking them off  when you finish it.<br>
					  could  also work as an indicator to show your roommates you're gonna do it and you're  aware of the mess.<br>
					  location  stick could change color if you havent done it - as a 2nd reminder. (have a  timer built in)</p>
					<p>kill the  dirt pet: lukewarm</p>
					<p>collect  them all: roommateG says if roommateJ alwyas wanted to clean, then he'd gladly  take him out <br>
					  should  have them work together for a shared reward. system could tell them they're  really close to their goal. dont know if there's much incentive to have their  room compete against another room. would work if it wasnt so visible and  explicit to everyone. the system should take on the chore of doing difficult  stuff of reminding ppl they need to do stuff. instead of everyone seeing that  one person isnt doing a lot of stuf in the house, it could show them that  another person is doing a lot and they should pick up the slack.</p>
