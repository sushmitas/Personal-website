					<p>Bunch of  short studies:</p>			  
					<p>Issues  are:<br>
					  - noise<br>
					  -  boyfriends/girlfriends<br>
					  -  sleeping times</p>
					<p>If issues  are small --&gt; live with it, keep up with it<br>
					  If bigger  --&gt; ask nicely, usually helps<br>
					  If asking  doesn't help --&gt; person is inconsiderate --&gt; bad experience<br>
					  If really  big --&gt; difference prevents from living together in a nice way, even if you  understand each other --&gt; bad experience</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>K:<br>
					  You can't  make people clean!!<br>
					  Show them  how dirty things really are (in the eyes of others)<br>
					  Make  clean people less anal.<br>
					  Don't be  a mother.<br>
					  Incentives  don't work -&gt; only if parents are coming or really impossible to live<br>
					  Have a  topic of conversation first, not immediately complaining</p>
					<p>Social  roles?<br>
					  Enforce  good part (I'm clean/i'm relaxed) , inhibit bad part? (i'm stressful/i'm dirty)</p>
					<p>liked  that they had keys and could let her in. could take care of twinkie for her.<br>
					  didn't  like social obligations - they'd ask her to hang out and she'd feel like she  had to hang out, but they weren't really friends. esp when they'd ask her to go  to a bday party for them. so it'd be her and a lot of ppl she didnt know so  she'd bring bf along.<br>
					  rules  about cleaning and noise. they were noisy, so she made rules. laundry machine  was right outside her room, and the rule was don't do laundry before noon b/c  she's sleeping.<br>
					  didn't  share anything. made arrangements about who would bring what. split cable bill  evenly. if they went on vacation and she stayed, then she'd cover a bigger  percentage of the bills.<br>
					  money is  a big problem with roommates in general - k was living with a girl in her  fraternity - and she had a much bigger room than k, and she was only paying $25  more per month. k said they should actually be splitting it according to size  of room, and the girl disagreed- saying that k already agreed when she moved  in.</p>
					<p>one of  her roommates used to make cookies all the time and share - made k happy. good  memories only came from the roommates that were her friends.<br>
					  really  doesnt like being woken up.</p>
					<p>ownership  of space and items is a big issue, and owing money. also the issue of who can  use what bathroom and when.<br>
					  we often  had where two people shared a bathroom and one person had one to their own and  we didnt use each others...and also the issue of when guests come over which  bathroom they use and whose guest it is</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>B:<br>
					  Does not  have currently have a roommate.<br>
					  I asked  about the last roommate he had which was less than a year ago.<br>
					  He lived  in a single but it was a shared suite so they shared bathroom and such.<br>
					  There  were 5 others that he shared with (total of 6).<br>
					  He was  friends with all of them.<br>
					  They were  roommates for 9 months.<br>
					  No  defined roles.<br>
					  No  arrangements.<br>
					  Only  issue was noise and the way it worked is when someone would want it quiet (ie.  going to sleep) he would say, &quot;I am going to sleep. Please keep it  down&quot; and others would respect this but there were no rules such as no  noise after midnight.<br>
					  The only  time they ever had problems with this &quot;arrangement&quot; was when there  were guests over. If the guest was not considerate and would not keep the noise  level down when asked, then it was understood that the one who invited the  guest would be required to ask the guest to leave.<br>
					  Things  just &quot;appeared&quot;. No one was responsible for buying tissues or  handsoap or anything. Someone would just buy it without being asked and it  would &quot;appear&quot; in the bathroom.</p>
					<p>Sometimes  the floor would just get cleaned and no one would know who did it. So there  would be no appreciation given to the person who did it because no one would  have any idea who had done it. B sometimes cleaned the floor without being  asked and received no feedback or thanks (probably because no one had any idea  he had done it). Usually did it because the floor was getting too messy for  him, not because of any social repercussions or suggestions. What does he  dislike about having a roommate? If the roommate is noisy and inconsiderate in  this regard.</p>
					<p>He did  not actively search for a roommate. A group of people who were all in the same  club (and already friends) were split up and assigned as roommates.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>E:<br>
					  Has one  roommate, Female.<br>
					  They are  good friends.<br>
					  They have  been rooming since August but know each other since last February.<br>
					  They cook  separately and each clean the utensils they used.<br>
					  They have  an arrangement that every week one of them cleans the kitchen and the other one  cleans the bathroom and vacuums.<br>
					  Every  week they switch so that they alternate weeks with each job.<br>
					  It is  flexible and sometimes if one of them is very busy, they will switch that week.  (The bathroom job is easier so the one who has less time will do the  bathroom/vacuum.) Sometimes if they are really busy they will even skip a week  entirely.<br>
					  Shared  stuff (whether it be bathroom or food) is done as follows:<br>
					  If it is  something that will only (or mostly) be used by one of them, then that person  pays for it.<br>
					  If it is  something that they both use frequently, then they split it monetarily,  although as far as who uses how much, it is pretty much whatever you use, you  use. However, if one of them wants to take a little bit from what the other one  paid for, they can pretty much take without asking.</p>
					<p>E will  sometimes ask her roommate to try something that she paid for (ie. bodywash)  just because she wants to share and give the roommate a chance to try it.</p>
					<p>They have  one bedroom which they share. One has a desk to do work on in the bedroom and  one has a desk in the living room. If one of them is going to sleep then the  one who is studying in the room, moves to the desk outside the bedroom.  Although, E says that they both prefer to study on their beds.</p>
					<p>E can't  study with loud noise while the roommate prefers studying with loud noise. So  when E is studying the roommate puts on headphones. When the roommate is  studying, she asks E to take her headphones off!</p>
					<p>They know  each other's schedules so they don't have much problem coordinating who gets  the bathroom when.</p>
					<p>Issues:<br>
					  2 weeks  ago the roommate cooked a lot and didn't clean up afterwards for days. When E  came in to eat, there were no clean dishes. She got frustrated and asked the  roommate to make sure to clean up and since then there has been no problem.</p>
					<p>There are  few people that E knows here that aren't in our program. Therefore, her  roommate is one of the few people in this city who E can vent to about issues  she is having in school or with people in our program. (If you want to find out  what E really thinks of you, make friends with her roommate. :-P)<br>
					  Last  semester, E was having a really hard time and she went home and went to sleep  at about 6PM and when she woke up at 12AM there were postit notes all over the  apartment in all the places that E usually goes/looks with smiley faces and  cute comments on them with little bags of Peanut M&amp;Ms (E's favorite) taped  to each postit. This really cheered E up! (She did this one more time.)<br>
					  Also,  about a week ago, E wasn't feeling well and the roommate cooked for her and  took care of her. E has done the same for her roommate.</p>
					<p>E likes  when... her roommate remembers her and sends her cute fwds often (Her roommate  knows her sense of humor and taste so the fwds she sents are usually  enjoyable.) She always thanks her roommate for the nice things that she does.</p>
					<p>E cooks  for her roommate (which her roommate loves) and writes cute comments on her  roommates whiteboard.</p>
					<p>What  doesn't she like about having a roommate? Sometimes she just wants to come home  and be alone after being surrounded by people all day long and she can't  because she shares a room. Her ideal would be to share an apartment but have to  bedrooms. She likes having a roommate b/c it gives her someone to talk to and  come home to and she wouldn't be happy if she didn't have that.</p>
					<p>They met  through Yahoo Groups for Indians who were coming over to America. At  first they were the only two girls. When they found out that their fathers know  each other they decided to room together (no real research involved.)</p>
					<p>Looks for  in a roommate: vegetarian, female, reliable (pays rent)</p>
					<p>They do  spend time socially together, hanging out in the lab, going to Indian events  and (spontaneously) going shopping.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>T:</p>
					<p>Had 2  roommates 6 months ago. not friends. living together for a year.<br>
					  roles:<br>
					  cleaning  schedule - roles would switch every month supposedly. but all there so  infrequently that they'd clean when things were dirty.<br>
					  in terms  of supplies for the place - whoever would buy stuff when they needed stuff.</p>
					<p>*would  note the cost on the whiteboard, and when bill time came up they'd divide the  costs equally. this was setup when he moved in, that's what the prev roommate  had done.</p>
					<p>t paid  rent every month to them. they'd tell him much he owed in utility.<br>
					  t cooked  a couple times and offered them food if they were around. (pleasing them)<br>
					  financial  benefit of having roommate.<br>
					  risk that  they'll do something offensive. roommates he's been with have tried to be civil  and tried to get along.<br>
					  never  actively searched for a roommate. looks for an apartment, and the roommate is  the side thing.<br>
					  would  look for someone who was financially stable, quiet, nice person in general.</p>
					<p>had 2  roommates 1-2 yrsago. not friends. lived together for a year.<br>
					  one good  roommate, one bad.<br>
					  roles:  him and the good roommate would clean stuff once in awhile. sometimes they  would have a specific cleaning day where one would clean the bathroom and other  would clean the kitchen.<br>
					  good  roommate cooked a lot, so he mostly kept the kitchen really clean.<br>
					  specific  cleaning days when company was coming over - friend visiting or whatever. good  roommate would ask that they clean.<br>
					  he and  good roommate were quiet. roommate2 would get stoned and leave stereo on really  loud. they'd have to pound on door to turn it door. if he wasn't there, then  they'd go in and turn it off.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>A:</p>
					<p>Rules and  issues<br>
					  They have  no set rules about anything, everything is based on being reasonable.<br>
					  You  respect each other, so for instance if one has to study, the other turns down  the volume or takes his music to the other room.<br>
					  There are  no issues between A and roommate.</p>
					<p>Any small  stuff?<br>
					  Sometimes  the plates will stack up, but it is not a big deal.<br>
					  A is  pretty neat, roommate a bit less, but he understands it.<br>
  &quot;It's  not a marriage, so you've got to bend a little.&quot;</p>
					<p>Fun stuff  together<br>
					  Go to  dinner on Friday or Saturday, other days impossible because of diverse  schedules.</p>
					<p>Cleaning<br>
					  The  apartment is not that clean, and basically A does most of the cleaning.<br>
					  He  vacuums once in a while, and cleans the bathroom a little one a week.</p>
					<p>The good  thing is the social part: it's good to know that there's someone there, nice to  have someone around. He noticed this when their breaks didn't overlap.<br>
					  The bad  thing is that you sometimes (especially in college) don't really have your own  space. This becomes a problem when the other person is dirty: He remembers  having a roommate that really didn't clean at all and left clothes on the floor  that started to smell. But usually this is only the case when the other person  is really filthy; you don't have to be super-neat.</p>
					<p>Favors<br>
					  When  people go to the grocery-store, they pick up stuff for the other roommates.  This is usually A, since he doesn't get home that late.</p>
					<p>Past  experiences? Bad experiences?<br>
					  College  was a totally different experience<br>
					  He had  one roommate that went to bed really early, so he couldn't use his PC after  11pm. That was annoying.<br>
					  Another  roommate was really loud. &quot;It was a funny guy, but he was just very  loud.&quot;<br>
					  And as  said before, another roommate just didn't clean up.<br>
  &quot;If  you have to do all the cleaning, that wears on a person.&quot;</p>
					<p>What do  you look for in a roommate?<br>
					  Compatible  personality: &quot;I'm not a big partier, so I need a bit of a structured  person, and I'm also an early riser, so not someone that keeps me up really  late. The person has to be considerate, that's the most important thing.&quot;</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>J:</p>
					<p>lived in  frat house<br>
					  house  manager who coordinated cleaning and bought supplies for the house.<br>
					  everyone  had roles for the week - had a sheet, and tasks divided by the room. had to  have it done by a certain time. had a meeting every week, so you had to have it  done by then. otherwise got made fun of.</p>
					<p>had a  game with the kitchen trash - first person who throws something in that falls  on the floor has to take it out.</p>
					<p>was  asleep at 2am - and ppl would come home from the bars and wake them up. just  ignored it usually, and once in awhile would go down and yell. they'd get  annoyed at him too for yelling, but usually they'd be too drunk to tell what was  going on. josh would go down and turn off music, and they wouldnt notice that  the music had stopped.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>D:</p>
					<p>Lives in  a house with 5 rooms. Has 3 roommates (one room not occupied).<br>
					  Live  together since August. not friends.</p>
					<p>No  assigned roles. At first they had rotating role lists. Every third week would  rotate to same position. Person in charge of this left and it died.</p>
					<p>They have  a cleaning lady once a week. No real cleaning done by D and his roommates. If  mess is bothering someone then they will ask the one who made the mess to clean  it up.<br>
					  Problem:  Dishwasher. No one ever wants to unload it. D feels like he does it most of the  time but is not sure if it just seems like that. Thinks it would be cool to  know how balanced things are.<br>
					  Rent is  split and each one of them has an individual lease (not dependent on each other  to collect rent).<br>
					  There  have been some problems especially when things were in transition ie. policy  was changed and they were required to pay for the cleaning lady instead of the  landlady but not all of them knew about it b/c the landlady told one of them  and the info was not transferred so the ones who didn't hear about it were  annoyed when they had to pay extra and did not know why.<br>
					  Problem:  Info does not get communicated if one knows about it, others may not.<br>
					  He buys  things the apartment needs and if it was expensive he will ask them to chip in.  Communication for this is done F2F.</p>
					<p>They each  have own space in kitchen (cabinets and shelves on fridge).</p>
					<p>No noise  policy. if someone asks others to be quiet then they listen. no problems with  this.</p>
					<p>Taking  out garbage. Usually gets done by garbage day but if it doesn't its bad cuz  they have to wait another week til the garbage truck comes again. If D sees it  hasn't been done yet the night before, then he does it but it usually has been  done.</p>
					<p>No  problems with cleanliness/living arrangements but D thinks the cleaning lady  helps this.</p>
					<p>Nice  things: Once one of the roommates cleaned out the entire kitchen and it was  very nice but D did not give feedback.</p>
					<p>D will  buy things for the house sometimes and not ask for compensation. ie.  papertowels. They thank him for this.<br>
					  Why does  he do this?<br>
					  Motivation:<br>
					  1) can  get products he likes instead of cheap generic version<br>
					  2) Less  hassle to just do it<br>
					  Not  vested in this relationship with roommates (end of the year it is over) so more  likely to just buy for himself</p>
					<p>Things he  doesn't like about having roommates:<br>
					  sharing  bathroom<br>
					  can't  play music loud</p>
					<p>But...  Likes having ppl around, less lonely, someone to say hi to</p>
					<p>When he  was looking for a place to stay he looked for a cheap place to live. Did not  know the others there but they are CMU students so he figured they would be ok.  he picks roommates that are middle of the road. not staying up partying til 4am  every night but are willing to go out and have fun. Looks for someone clean.  Also considers of the guy has a girlfriend b/c that can end up being an issue  if she hangs around a lot. non-smoking.</p>
					<p>If needs  to get a msg to roommates: F2F and sometimes e-mail<br>
					  Leaves  notes for roommates out on the dining room table. They also have a list on the  fridge of things that need to be bought but it doesn't get updated when those  things actually get purchased.</p>
			  <p>His  roommates before this: 2 others. 1 was a friend from hi skool and the other was  friends with his friend from hi skool. It was differnet b/c he was working so  he was in the apartment more. It was more fun, social, partied, had breakfast  together, watched football. had ppl over. made food. the friend of his friend  was unclean. did not contribute to the cleaning but b/c the other 2 did (D and  his friend) it never became an issue. didn't think the roommate would change  his behavior so never addressed it.</p>
