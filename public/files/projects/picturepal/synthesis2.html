					<p>Our team spent time brainstorming and came up with 64 ideas for smart home devices. Below are some of the ideas that we had: </p>
				  <p><strong>Kudos</strong> - an explicit "currency" used to express appreciation.<br>                  <strong>CleanPet</strong> - a pet that hates dirt and noise, and that the dorm has to keep alive together<br>                  <strong>Kill the DirtPet</strong> - a pet that loves dirt and noise,  and that the dorm has to kill as soon as possible (it respawns every  week or so, or every time things are dirty, like cockroaches) (oh, we  should make them really cute and fluffy, and find very creative ways  for them to die - see happy tree friends!)<br>                  <strong>DormBlog</strong> - a blog for your dorm that keeps public  member pages that get filled by your roommates, and personal pages to  (anonymously) communicate issues<br>                  <strong>HouseHeroes</strong> - a system that takes stereotypical  attirbutes of persons, recent and upcoming events in the house, and  issues, and puts them in a journal-style web-comic<br>                  <strong>BathroomLiterature</strong> - same as HouseHeroes, but then in the form of a gossip tabloid that can be read when going to the bathroom<br>                  <strong>ArtisticIssues</strong> - let people communicate emotions,  issues, and implicit rules through artistic expressions (photography,  painting) that are displayed in the living room<br>                  <strong>AutoArtisticIssues</strong> - same as ArtisticIssues, but then automatically generated by the system<br>                  <strong>ChoreLottery</strong> - if a roommate has spare time, he can  grab a ball from the ChoreLottery. Some balls contain something cool,  others contain a small chore<br>                  <strong>WishList</strong> - every roommate has a WishList that holds  some simple wishes the roommate would like to have fulfilled, like "I  wish the bathroom would be cleaned", "I wish I had more time to sleep",  "I wish my project wasn't killing me". These wishes are directed to no  one in specific, but roommates can be considerate and/or do some favors  with regard to these wishes.<br>                  <strong>ThanksMate</strong> - whenever someone does a certain chore,  the system thanks the person immediately, and lets the other roommates  know how cool the roommate is. Combined with WishList, the chore-doer  gets a personal "thanks, mate!" if a personal request is fulfilled.<br>                  <strong>ConsiderAid</strong> - whenever something is bothering a  roommate, he/she can enter a "complaint" into the system. However,  every time a "complaint" is entered, the roommate will see a (similar)  complaint about him/herself. (this one's a bit negative)<br>                  <strong>Dormacle</strong> - a more "covert" version of the ConsiderAid:  the roommates pose their complaint as a question to the Dormacle, which  then gives a mystic advice as an answer. The advice is in fact a  solution to another roommate's complaint.<br>                  <strong>Suggestimate</strong> - the system estimates the implicit rules  in the minds of the individual roommates, and suggests certain  behaviors to the other roommates accordingly ("if the toilet seems  dirty, we clean it immediately" --&gt; "I think you should clean the  toilet, it seems dirty")<br>                  <strong>RuleCloud</strong> - the system estimates the implicit rules  and puts them on a visual display. Roommates can assign values to the  rules on the display, and highly valued rules become more prominent.<br>                  <strong>SmartLevel</strong> - put an intelligent meter on thermostats  and audio devices that controls heat/volume and automatically takes  into account the preferences of every roommate<br>                  <strong>RoommateTrivia</strong> - how much do you know about your  roommate? Do you know the last time he/she cleaned, took out the trash,  helped you out? A trivia game to test your knowledge on this<br>                  <strong>RoommateOfTheWeek</strong> - a ranking system that determines  which roommate is the most considerate or clean (possibly tied into  ThanksMate or Kudos). This roommates gets to select the TV channel,  radio playlist, or dinner meal<br>                  <strong>SharedObjectives</strong> - the system splits the dorm in two  groups and sets an objective for each group (f.i. cleaning). Both  groups put some money in. The group that performs their task the best  gets to do a certain activity (movie, dinner, etc.) with the money won.<br>                  <strong>ButcherPaper</strong> - put butcher paper on the walls so that people can write anything anywhere.<br>                  <strong>OpenDoor</strong> - when a roommate is available the door is  open. When the roommate wants to be alone the door is closed. When the  roommate wants silence the door is hermetically shut. <strong>MagnetTug:</strong> A magnetic field that goes on a wall with  different feelings on different sides. Roommates can drag their avatar  towards a certain feeling to signify how they are feeling. Indirect way  of showing roommate how you are feeling.<br>				  <strong>MagnetTug+:</strong> Similar to magnet tug but also has chore  icons. So for example one could drag his avatar and kitchen sink  towards sad on the wallboard and that would signify that he is sad  about something to do with the sink.<br>				  <strong>BathVis:</strong> Visualization on the bathroom door showing  what times roommates usually use the bathroom and how long it usually  takes them. Could be used to coordinate bathroom times.<br>				  <strong>DoorVis:</strong> Visualization of when each of you come in or out<br>				  <strong>MessageMe:</strong> We discussed this system before. A message board that allows you to leave notes for your roommate.<br>				  <strong>MessageMeWeb:</strong> Could be displayed on a website so you  could go to your page: www.daniel.messageme.com and it would show what  I was broadcasting. Or could be private so whatever you write on the  board will only get sent to one person.<br>				  <strong>MessageMeAvatar:</strong> Could possibly be used as a web avatar also so whatever you write on your board would be on your facebook avatar for example.<br>				  <strong>FrontRemind:</strong> Problem- I find that when my garbage is  full, I never remember to take it out because my garbage is not near my  front door so when I am leaving the house I have no reminder that I  need to take it out. Maybe it reminds by front door that I need to take  out the garbage or pick up dry cleaning.<br>				  <strong>ChoreAssigner:</strong> Chore list that keeps track of who did  what chore each time and assigns the chore to a roommate based on who  has done it the least (or other criteria).<br>				  <strong>CollectEmAll:</strong> System keeps track of roommate chores.  Users get little icons next to their name whenever a chore is done sort  of like a star chart. Whoever gets to some predetermined goal first,  gets treated (to dinner or movie etc.) by other roommates.<br>				  <strong>NoiseMinder:</strong> System gauges noise level in your room  and checks whether lights are off or on in roommates room. If lights  are off, suggests that you turn down volume.<br>				  <strong>Happiness Scale:</strong> You do things for your roommate, your  roommate does things for you. When things are done for you, you move  your happiness scale higher. When things aren't being done, you move it  lower. Gives roommate knowledge of your state. Goal is to make your  roommate happy.<br>				  <strong>RoomHeat:</strong> Measures how much of the time you spend  together and tracks trends. When roommates are avoiding each other,  proposes means of making up. (May have to track trends of what chores  are being done and what aren't to propose how to fix it.)<br>				  <strong>StressBall:</strong> Depending on how hard you squeeze it,  that's how angry you are. Can convey moods to roommate. Two stress  balls that communicate with each other.<br>				  <strong>LocationSticks:</strong> Place a stick near something that  needs to be cleaned/taken care of. This prompts a blinking beacon on a  birdseyeview map of your house that shows everyone which locations need  to be cleaned/taken care of. There may be multiple sticks.<br>	              <strong>MoodMeasure:</strong> Measures roommates mood so you can gauge when would be a good time to talk to them about something.<br>			      <strong>Centralized shopping wishlist:</strong> When things run out, you add it to a central list and when roommates go shopping, they can access this list and cross things off/pick things up for each other. Along these lines, roommates could create wish lists and you'd buy little gifts for each other.					  
				  <br>				  <strong>Chore Notifier:</strong> let ppl know who did what chores. You wash the dishes and it tells everyone else. "Good news, Ann did the dishes." <br>				  <strong>  Dinner bell: </strong>Could send coordination messages to tell roommates you're cooking and will have extra. Could make this more ambient/less invasive so that it's not just like emailing/SMS'ing out. So could have something that represents dinner at the apartment/home.
				  <br>				  <strong>Food preference list: </strong>Have central food preference list and you could figure out what to cook taking into account food preferences.
				  <br>				  <strong>Who's home?: </strong>Let ppl know who is home (mobile system) and what they're up to in the apartment so you know whether to come home or not.
				  <br>				  <strong>Bored button:</strong> Bored button that ppl could press in their bedrooms if you see someone else is bored, can go chat witht hem or all come out to the common area.
		          <br>		          <strong>		  Tivo group recommendations: </strong> makes recommendations that would apply to everyone so ppl can watch together.
				  <br>				  <strong>  Electronic post-its: </strong> elec. post-its near whatever you're thanking them for -> gets sent to the roommate's room <br>				  <strong>Friends expander: </strong>something to help roommates expand network to friends of roommates?
				  <br>				  <strong>Visualization of Skills/Interests: </strong>Roommates might be able to learn from each other. E.g. - your roommate plays guitar and you're interested the system helps you find common time. If have same interests, system can help out suggesting events/activities for two ppl to do.System suggests activities/games for the room.
				  <br>				  <strong>  Important events: </strong>Gives roommates a heads up about important events in others' lives. E.g. warn others when bday is coming up. tell ppl other ppl's deadlines so they can send good luck msgs or pick up extra chores.
				  <br>				  <strong> Roommate teams: </strong>ppl like social aspect of living together - could it be teams? my room competes against neighbors' team?
			      <br>			      <strong>	  Health indicator: </strong>display that signifies "health" of hte room <br>			      <strong>  Train tracks:</strong> delivery system to run around home and deliver things/msgs to ppl. e.g. if i bake cookies it could send one to each roommate to bring them out.
				  <br>				  <strong>  House robot: </strong>same thing as train system but as a little delivery robot.
				  <br>				  <strong>  Personalized games: </strong>presonalized for roommates. e.g. taboo with names as the word and characteristics as the taboo
		          <br>		          <strong>		  Kodak Moments: </strong>photo system that takes pics during "kodak moments". fixed in common areas. detected by laughter meter, facial expressions, etc. <br>		          <strong>  Messageboards: </strong>on bedroom doors where you could leave personalized msgs and also lock the contents so it's private. ppl can still see someone left you a msg, but not what it is. maybe whiteboard on inside of the door to unlock and see private msgs.
				  <br>				  <strong>  Shared interests: </strong>visualization in common room about who has shared interests -> e.g. Bob and Adam drink same beers. <br>				  <strong>  Virtual Closet:</strong> girls that share clothes with roommates. Don't want ppl physically going through your closet, but what if they wanted to know if you had shoes that would match their outfit. Could show virtual closet and they could filter by style.</p>
